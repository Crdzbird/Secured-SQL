# Secured-SQL
One thing that i was always wish to develop was a way to secure all the procedures in the database.

As you know even the most efficients programs has some issues related with security, some are in the backend others in the client side, but almost no one take care of the DB side.

So that's why this project was developed.

You can add the functions to any part or even call it from your Backend and sanitize.

- SQL-INJECTIONS
- XSS
- EMPTY VALUES
- Tags(yeah tags like the ones that javascript uses)

This repo i know that can grow even more, so if you like it then :star: can be appreciated or if you wanna add some functionality a Pull Request is always welcome!

DONE:
- [x] MYSQL
- [x] POSTGRESQL
- [x] SQL-SERVER


TODO:
- [ ] ORACLE
